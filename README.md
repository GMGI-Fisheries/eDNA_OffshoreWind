**Abstract** 

The U.S. is expanding renewable energy sources to combat climate change including large-scale offshore wind developments off every U.S. coast that will likely impact the surrounding fisheries and ecosystems. Construction timelines for wind lease areas in southern New England are well-ahead of the rest of the country, providing an opportunity to establish the impacts of offshore wind development on biodiversity while lease areas elsewhere are still in the planning stages. Therefore, establishing long-term biodiversity monitoring before, during, and after construction using methods that can persist throughout all stages of installation is crucial to fully understanding the environmental impacts of wind development. To monitor biodiversity in wind energy areas, we established a vertebrate eDNA metabarcoding survey from May-November 2023 at 40 sites within three southern New England offshore wind lease areas with the most advanced construction timelines. At each site, one liter of bottom and surface water was collected and filtered in the field using 1 um cellulose nitrate filters and the Smith-root eDNA sampler. DNA was extracted using the Qiagen PowerSoil Pro kit and metabarcoding was performed using custom 12S V5 primers to target all vertebrates. This study provides vital information regarding the distribution and biodiversity of fisheries species in response to wind turbine development. Considering the extensive interest in offshore wind, particularly in Massachusetts, eDNA serves as a powerful tool to assess concerns regarding the potential impacts of renewable energy on commercial and recreational fisheries.
